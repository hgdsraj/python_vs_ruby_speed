# Python VS Ruby in a Selection Sort

This is some quick throwaway code testing Ruby against Python in terms of speed sorting an array using selection sort.

Tested over 40 trials using Linux time function.

Results:

## Python
* 0.0098 Seconds

## Ruby
* 0.087325 seconds

## CPP
* 0.00122 seconds

In This particular task, CPP is 90 times faster than Python, which is ~11 times faster than Ruby!
